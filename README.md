After every change (key pressed, file in focus changed, file saved, file opened) visualisation of metamodel/model is exported to svg file 
if metamodel/model is in correct state and visualisation of metamodel/model is showed 
in last tab of misc part of Ninja IDE GUI.

There can be multiple models in one project, but only one at the time is going to be visualized
(last one changed, last one in focus or last one saved).
